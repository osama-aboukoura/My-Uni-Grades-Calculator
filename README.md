# My-Uni-Grades-Calculator

## Background: 

A university grades calculator that follows the grading system for any 3 year course at the Informatics department at my university (King's College London).

The ratio of year 1 to year 2 to year 3 is:
1:3:5 

which means:

Year 1 carries 1/9 of the overall degree weight. 

Year 2 carries 3/9 of the overall degree weight. 

Year 3 carries 5/9 of the overall degree weight. 

## Run the Code: 

To run the code: 

1. You will first need to have Python3 installed on your machine. You can download it from this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


2. Clone the repo on your pc as follows:

  ```git clone https://github.com/osama-aboukoura/My-Uni-Grades-Calculator.git```

3. Change directory into the directory that you just cloned:

  ```cd My-Uni-Grades-Calculator```

4. Type the following Python command to run the code: 

  ```Python3 uniGrades.py```
  
**The program allows the user to save their grades in the input fields they used to type these grades in using an SQLite database.**
